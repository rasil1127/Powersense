# Powersense

## Introduction
PowerSense enables you to parallel multiple batteries in your battery-powered equipment. It has several advantages over other devices that do the same thing.
- High voltage & current support
- Utilise N-channel mosfets for efficient low-side switching
- Open-source hardware
- Can intelligently switch between 2 connected batteries to bring the voltage difference to within Â±1V then connect them in parallel
- Batteries with different chemistries, voltage levels, and cell counts can be connected.

### Rita
#### What is Rita?
> Rita analyzes voltages of the internal and external batteries, switching their positive power leads so that the charge does not flow from one battery to another, keeping the ability for the controller to consume current from both batteries and recover energy back when braking.

#### What does it do in a nutshell?
> [!NOTE]
> I have not analysed a Rita module to see its working principles this information may not be 100% correct.

It will switch to whatever battery has a higher voltage and drain that first. It reads both batteries' voltages to determine which one has a higher voltage potential, the same as what Powersense does. However, it is using P-channel mosfets as explained above by the original creator "*switching their positive power leads*" It cannot be N-channel mosfets since those would require the positives to be common and negatives to be switched. It also emulates BMSes for the scooter lineup by NINEBOT and XIAOMI.

### Aliexpress battery switchers
#### What do they do?

They have a small integrated IC internally that uses P-channel mosfets like Rita to switch between batteries positive with the ground being common. this approach is not that great since P-channel mosfets are much more inefficient since they usually have a higher RDS<sub>on</sub> resistance.
