# Powersense

## Introduction
PowerSense enables you to parallel multiple batteries in your battery-powered equipment. It has several advantages over other devices that do the same thing.
- High voltage & current support
- Utilises N-channel mosfets for efficient low-side switching
- Open-source hardware
- Can intelligently switch between 2 connected batteries to bring the voltage difference to within Â±1V then connect them in parallel
- Batteries with different chemistries, voltage levels, and cell counts can be connected.

### Rita
#### What is Rita?
> Rita analyzes voltages of the internal and external batteries, switching their positive power leads so that the charge does not flow from one battery to another, keeping the ability for the controller to consume current from both batteries and recover energy back when braking.

#### What does it do in a nutshell?
> [!NOTE]
> I have not analysed a Rita module to see its working principles this information may not be 100% correct.

It will switch to whatever battery has a higher voltage and drain that first. It reads both batteries' voltages to determine which one has a higher voltage potential, the same as what Powersense does. However, it is using P-channel mosfets as explained above by the original creator "*switching their positive power leads*" It cannot be N-channel mosfets since those would require the positives to be common and negatives to be switched. It also emulates BMSes for the scooter lineup by NINEBOT and XIAOMI.

### Aliexpress battery switchers
#### What do they do?

They have a small integrated IC internally that uses P-channel mosfets like Rita to switch between batteries positive with the ground being common. this approach is not that great since P-channel mosfets are inefficient since they usually have a higher RDS<sub>on</sub> resistance.

## Firmware details
The firmware will not be open-sourced with the Powersense device. **However the disclaimer still applies**. I will make it as easy as possible for anyone to create a custom firmware for example there exists an Arduino-like API for the STM8 family of microprocessors such as [Sduino](https://tenbaht.github.io/sduino/) which will be easy to pick up and work with. however, the STM8 can be programmed via ST visual develop and COSMIC C compiler.

> [!NOTE]
> The four analogue inputs of the STM8 (A2, A1) are multiplexed between STM8 physical pin 20, 19 respectively. 

### Voltage accusation calculations

#### A/D calculations
```
(AIN / 1024) * 5
```

**AIN** is the multiplexed analogue input and it is divided by **1024** which is the internal 10-bit ADC resolution. it is multiplied by **5** which is the supply voltage of the IC. 

#### Resistor divider divisions
```
537.3134328358209
```

This number is how much the original voltage is divided by going through the on-board resistor divider thus in software the acquired voltage must be multiplied by the same number to get the original voltage. 

#### AMC1200 voltage mapping calculation
```
0 + (0.251 - 0) * (AIN - 2.55) / (3.59 - 2.55)
```

**0.251** is the maximum value in volts that going to be outputted from the voltage divider.

**AIN** is the multiplexed analogue input

**2.55** is the minimum voltage that the AMC will output this can be seen on the datasheet for the IC.

**3.95** is the maximum voltage that the AMC will output this can be seen on the datasheet for the IC.
